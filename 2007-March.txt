Hello all,

I'm pretty new here, but I think I have come up with a pretty good new 
character: please tell me what you think:

Salsa is a penguin who is the ruler of one of the worlds/islands 
<http://supertux.lethargik.org/wiki/World>. Salsa had all of his 
treasures taken away by Nolok, when his beautiful Royal City was raided 
by him. He meets up with Tux and goes help him free Penny. When he does 
free her, he discovers she is his long lost sister. He takes the 
treasure, and Tux, Penny, and Salsa all live in the world Salsa rules as 
kings.

I'm open to all suggestions, so please mail me back.
